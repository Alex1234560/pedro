------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- When on field -------
 - tune shooting ranges
 - Tune back range start which determines the flywheel error that is allowed when shooting from the back vs the front.
 - also tune the allowed error of the flywheel for the front and back.
 - tune aiming switching at a certain y point, it is implemented but needs to be tuned.

 -------- High Priority -------\
- make interpolation table for the values for velocity comepnsation

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make flywheel PIDF better
- make ball throughput better
- driving braking behaviour
- make autos better.
- Make teleop also store turret rotation and pose location in case we need to rerun teleop

-------- Low Priority ---------
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
