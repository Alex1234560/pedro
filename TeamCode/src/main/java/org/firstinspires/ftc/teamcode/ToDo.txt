------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- High Priority -------
- make ball throughput better
- make interpolation table for the values for velocity comepnsation
- make flywheel PIDF better

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- driving braking behaviour
- make autos better.
- Make teleop also store turret rotation and pose location in case we need to rerun teleop

-------- Low Priority ---------
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
