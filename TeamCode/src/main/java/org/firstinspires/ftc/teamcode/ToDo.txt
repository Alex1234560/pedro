 -------- High Priority -------
- test interpolation.
- make repositioning button to re-calibrate position in case it gets messed up.
- make emptying classifier more effective with time on how much to stay on lever.

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make flywheel PIDF better

------- Things to test ----------
- try turret motor with Breaking behaviour at power 0;

-------- Low Priority ---------
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- adjust PIDF so that correction back to the right place is more aggresive and works better ( Driving ).
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.

- add encoder so that u cant go back and forth and ruin the gears in the intake.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
