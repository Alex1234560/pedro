 -------- High Priority -------
- Measure odometry pod position so that turns are right.
- TEST auto to see if it shoots after the first 3 balls
- test driving modes on both sides and non field centric
- test Auto on both sides
- make auto park and last less than 30s.

-------- tips for making auto faster --------
- Make the flywheel always be spinning
- make the turret start pointing to the front not the back.
- Intake balls at speed 1 not 0.5
- Shoot while moving ( need to implement just time or smh like that, since when moving shoot detection doesnt work.

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- try turret motor with Breaking behaviour at power 0.
- Get the locations of everything onto another file, so that it can be globally changed, also put the flip code there.
- make everything manually adjustable in case of trouble.
- check how to make aiming consistent, rn it works well when rotated to the front of the robot but not in the back.

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
- understand why the problem of turret restting angle to not conflict with cable was solved so weirdly.
- Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.
- also rn the code is assuming the turret is in the middle which it is not, needs to be fixed
- adjust PIDF so that correction back to the right place is more aggresive and works better ( Driving ).
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.
- In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
- Make parking button for teleop.
- Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way

--------- only do if done with everything else -----------
- Make Back Auto detect balls.

------—-------IDEA-------------
based on the april tag angle rhat its being seen from
( not the bearing ) , u can add more angle to the bearing 
so that the turret points to the goal and not to
the tag
