 -------- High Priority -------
1 make Auto Aiming aim to the goals. and make sure it works well.
1 Make new quadratic equations or pass the existing ones to the new system
1 finish an auto that's acceptable ( even if its 3 ball auto )

----------- Medium Priority ----------
1 make everything manually adjustable in case of trouble.
2 Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.

-------- needs testing ----
test 2 sides of the auto ( i dont think the red side works )

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
0 Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.
1 make the delay between balls smaller.
5 In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
6 Make parking button for teleop.
3 Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way

--------- only do if done with everything else -----------
1 Make Back Auto detect balls.
