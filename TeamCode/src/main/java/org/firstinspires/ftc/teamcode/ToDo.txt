 -------- High Priority -------

 - FIRST ON PRIORITY LISt, Auto is not ending up in right place even though everything is measured right 
- finish an auto that's acceptable ( even if its 3 ball auto )
- try turret motor with Breaking behaviour at power 0.
- HUGE PRIORITY add isTurretRotationBusy() function so u can't shoot if turret isn't pointed correctly
- Turret switches back around at angle -170 instead of the variable SWITCH_ANGLE_NEG, needs to be fixed.

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- Get the locations of everything onto another file, so that it can be globally changed, also put the flip code there.
- make everything manually adjustable in case of trouble.
- check how to make aiming consistent, rn it works well when rotated to the front of the robot but not in the back.


-------- needs testing ----
test 2 sides of the auto ( i dont think the red side works )

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
- Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.
- also rn the code is assuming the turret is in the middle which it is not, needs to be fixed
- adjust PIDF so that correction back to the right place is more aggresive and works better ( Driving ).
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.
- make the delay between balls smaller.
- In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
- Make parking button for teleop.
- Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way

--------- only do if done with everything else -----------
- Make Back Auto detect balls.


------—-------IDEA-------------
based on the april tag angle rhat its being seen from
( not the bearing ) , u can add more angle to the bearing 
so that the turret points to the goal and not to
the tag
