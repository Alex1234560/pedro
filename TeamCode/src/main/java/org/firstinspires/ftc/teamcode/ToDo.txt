------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- When on field -------
- check front auto classifier emptying on dif locations in case we auto with someone.
- Tune VelocityInterpolation values.
- tune GOAL_X_WHEN_AT_BOTTOM_OF_FIELD with the panels.



 -------- High Priority -------
- memorize reset position location and button clicks.
- memorize and teach diego how to control turret if eveyrhting goes wrong.


----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make ball throughput better
- make sure diego knows shooter button override for aiming.
- make auto also intake from the tunnel, so we can collaborate from exsurgo.

-------- Low Priority ---------
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- if robot isn't moving in teleop, use follower.holdPoint(lastTargetPose); to keep it where it is.
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
