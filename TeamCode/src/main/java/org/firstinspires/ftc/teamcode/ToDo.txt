------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- When on field -------

- check back shooting consistency
- tune the allowed error of the flywheel for the front and back.
- tune aiming switching at a certain y point, it is implemented but needs to be tuned.
- Tune VelocityInterpolation values.
- check turret rotation aiming consistency
- bug check


 -------- High Priority -------
not sure if clearing classifier is working on new auto front, check that in field :).
- test new autos in field :)

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make ball throughput better

-------- Low Priority ---------
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- if robot isn't moving in teleop, use follower.holdPoint(lastTargetPose); to keep it where it is.
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
