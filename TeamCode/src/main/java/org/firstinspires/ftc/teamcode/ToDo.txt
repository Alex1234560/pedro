------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- When on field -------
 - tune shooting ranges
 - Tune back range start which determines the flywheel error that is allowed when shooting from the back vs the front.
 - also tune the allowed error of the flywheel for the front and back.
 - tune aiming switching at a certain y point, it is implemented but needs to be tuned.
 - Tune VelocityInterpolation values.


 -------- High Priority -------
 - bug check
 - preloading into shooter at auto isn't working ideally.
 - make controllers simple, and during manual control prevent accidental clicks for changing speed or angle.
 - implement the shooterblocker into auto, maybe u can make a better shooter class along the way

----------- Medium Priority ----------

- make flywheel PIDF better, one optioon is to modify f on the fly, so next tijme u spin up the flywheel in game itll be more accurate.
- make ball throughput better
- make autos better.
- Make teleop also store turret rotation and pose location in case we need to rerun teleop

-------- Low Priority ---------
- if robot isn't moving in teleop, use follower.holdPoint(lastTargetPose); to keep it where it is.
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
