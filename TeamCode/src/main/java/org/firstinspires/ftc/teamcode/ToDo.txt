------ for levi -------
- Check interpolation code for bugs.

 -------- When on field -------
- check back shooting consistency
 - tune the allowed error of the flywheel for the front and back.
 - tune aiming switching at a certain y point, it is implemented but needs to be tuned.
 - Tune VelocityInterpolation values.
 - check turret rotation aiming consistency
  - bug check


 -------- High Priority -------
- make manual adjustable values easier to use, so it can rotate according to odo or not.
- finish simple auto thing.
- make auto for back to match with exsurgo


----------- Medium Priority ----------
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- make flywheel PIDF better, one optioon is to modify f on the fly, so next tijme u spin up the flywheel in game itll be more accurate.
- make ball throughput better
- make autos better.
- Make teleop also store turret rotation and pose location in case we need to rerun teleop

-------- Low Priority ---------
- if robot isn't moving in teleop, use follower.holdPoint(lastTargetPose); to keep it where it is.
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.

- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
