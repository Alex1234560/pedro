 -------- High Priority -------
- check interpolation for any bug that could be present
- make tuning button harder to press by accident.
-make ball throughput better
- make interpolation table for the values for velocity comepnsation
- driving braking behaviour
----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make flywheel PIDF better
- make a way so that if the wrong color is chosen, the teleop won’t be ruint
- Make teleop also store turret rotation and pose location in case we need to rerun teleop

make it so that u have to click joistick to activate function, during manual adjustmeent tho it might be too much of a hastle.

------- Things to test ----------
- try turret motor with Breaking behaviour at power 0;

-------- Low Priority ---------
- switch processing for turret from degrees to radians for more precise measurements.
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.


 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
