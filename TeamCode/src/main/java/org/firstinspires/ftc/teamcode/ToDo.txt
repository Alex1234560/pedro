 -------- High Priority -------
- make shooting really consistent
- camera compensation make better
- make a thing where all values are manually adjustable for tuning

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- try using integrated PIDF instead of costum, makes code cleaner
- make the button to activate intake, the one on top called bumper dispense extra balls that are grabbed during intaking.
- fix the distance sensor mechanism not working super well. ( tune the CHANGE_POINT Variable in distanceSensorClass )
- test AUTO
- FIX auto parking, its rlly slow, and vibrates a lot.
- make a shoot button instead of a shoot trigger.
base distance off of camera when possible.

-------- tips for making auto faster --------
- Intake balls at speed 1 not 0.5
- Shoot while moving ( need to implement just time or smh like that, since when moving shoot detection doesnt work.
- to shoot while moving we could also just make the path slower

------- Things to test ----------
- test autos ( blue and red ) with transition between auto and teleop.
- try turret motor with Breaking behaviour at power 0.

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
- Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.
- also rn the code is assuming the turret is in the middle which it is not, needs to be fixed
- adjust PIDF so that correction back to the right place is more aggresive and works better ( Driving ).
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.
- In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
- Make parking button for teleop.
- Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way

- add encoder so that u cant go back and forth and ruin the gears in the intake.

--------- only do if done with everything else -----------
- Make Back Auto detect balls.

------—-------IDEA-------------
based on the april tag angle rhat its being seen from
( not the bearing ) , u can add more angle to the bearing 
so that the turret points to the goal and not to
the tag

 ------ BEFORE COMP -------
 - BUG CHECK
 - Take photos of configuration in case it gets deleted
