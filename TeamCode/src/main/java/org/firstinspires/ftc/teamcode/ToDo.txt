 -------- High Priority -------
1 make turret auto aiming work, make sure limits work.
1 Make new quadratic equations or pass the existing ones to the new system
1 Make eveyrthing in the autoaiming work again


----------- Medium Priority ----------
1 also make everything manually adjustable in case of trouble.
2 in auto, make the ball feeder stop if flywheel isnt up to speed, and count balls based on speed change witouth changing states each time it happens.
3 Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.


 ----- Mostly done ----------
Create simpler TeleOp with shared functions (auto & teleop)

-------- needs testing ----
Make 2 sides for the auto

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
0 Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary, and make the delay between balls smaller
5 In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
6 Make parking button for teleop.
3 Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way
4 Make Back Auto detect balls.
