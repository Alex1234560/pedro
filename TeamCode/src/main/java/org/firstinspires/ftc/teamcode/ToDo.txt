 -------- High Priority -------
- finish an auto that's acceptable ( even if its 3 ball auto )
- ODOMETRY pods position i believe are measured wrong, it needs to be remasured and make sure when robot is rotating it appears the same on the dashboard.

----------- Medium Priority ----------
- make everything manually adjustable in case of trouble.
- Right now I changed the speed tolerance for shooting, since by the time the ball gets to the shooter it is already up to speed, we need a better way to do it since recovering times will be longer at the back, and it wont work as well.
- check how to make aiming consistent, rn it works well when rotated to the front but not in the back, I beleive its the odometry pods placement and aslo that turret isnt centered.
- integrate bearing into turret autoaiming, so that when the camera detects a bearing difference, it can be corrected. and also it could be possible to jump to camera values when a code is detected.

-------- needs testing ----
test 2 sides of the auto ( i dont think the red side works )

- --- ---- Low Priority ---------
- Adjust PIDF for shooter if neccesary.
- make the delay between balls smaller.
- In Every auto add a timer that when it runs out it triggers a park function out of the launch zone.
- Make parking button for teleop.
- Make Back auto that shoots and then moves out of the way

--------- only do if done with everything else -----------
- Make Back Auto detect balls.
